# Shooter Demo

Shooter Demo for Unity version 2022.3.20f1.

## Overview

This demo showcases the development of three distinct weapons with different special ammo. The demo consists of two scenes:

### Scene 1: UI Interface

The first scene features a basic UI interface with buttons and a selector. The buttons trigger various character animations, while the selector allows users to choose the animation for the character located in the center of the screen.

Additionally, the interface includes a "Change Scene" button that enables players to transition to the second scene.

### Scene 2: Shooter Demo

The second scene introduces the Shooter Demo with three unique weapons, each exhibiting different bullet behaviors:

#### Hand Cannon
A weapon designed to shoot a regular cannonball in a parabolic trajectory, resembling a red cannon.

#### Gravity Weapon
This weapon shoots gravity ammo, which attracts scene objects to the bullet. When the distance is close enough, the objects move around the bullet until it disappears. The Gravity Weapon is represented by a golden rifle.

#### Extra Weapon
This weapon shoots a particular ammo that alters the target's scale in different sizes. If the target receives two or more ammo shots, its size increases. The Extra Weapon is depicted as a purple rifle.

## Usage
